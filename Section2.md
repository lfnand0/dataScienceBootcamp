# Section 2: The Field of Data Science - The Various Data Science Disciplines

## Analysis vs Analytics
* Analysis: refers to PAST EVENTS, which are analysed and return answers for "how?" and "why?"
* Analytics: explores potential FUTURE EVENTS, looking for patterns and figuring out what you can do in the future. It branches off into two different areas:
  - Qualitative: Using intuition and experience in conjunction with analysis to plan your next business move
  - Quantitative: Applying formulas and algorithms to numbers you have gathered from your analysis.

## Business, Data Science and Data Analytics:
* OBS: The therm "Analytics" is often used to describe both Analytics and Analysis.
* (*) = Business Analytics, (#) = Data Science, (&) = Data Analytics;
* (BI) = Business Inteligence (process of analysing and reporting historical business data);
* (AI) = Artifical Inteligence;
* (ML) = Machine Learning (the ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed);
